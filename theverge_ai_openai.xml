This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">The AI-powered history search started appearing in beta versions of Microsoft Edge last week. “After this feature is turned on, sites you visit will be shown in enhanced history search results,” explains Microsoft in its <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-beta-channel">beta channel release notes</a>. “An on-device model is trained using your data, which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.”</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">This optional feature seems like less of a privacy risk than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319609/microsoft-recall-hands-on-notepad">Microsoft’s Recall feature</a> that screenshots most of what you do on a Copilot Plus PC to make it easier to search for websites, photos, and documents. The use of an on-device model that’s limited to your browser history is certainly better than having to store everything on your screen in a local database.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the AI-powered browsing history, Microsoft is also adding a media control center to Edge that lets you control multiple media sources from websites. This media control center includes quick access to Edge’s picture-in-picture mode, which itself is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681499/microsoft-edges-picture-in-picture-mode-is-getting-better-controls">getting better controls</a>, and the ability to control music, video, or other sounds that are playing inside Edge.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <figure> <img alt="" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/starlingbank.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" /> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <p class="has-text-align-none">Starling Bank, one of the UK’s digital challenger banks, has launched a new AI-powered tool that will answer questions about your spending habits. You can now easily find out how much you’ve spent at Amazon in a particular month, how much money you’ve wasted on fast food outlets over the past year, or how much cash you’ve received over a particular period.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Starling’s AI tool, or enhanced search as the bank calls it, is an opt-in feature that enables a prompt where you can ask questions about your spending habits. The tool, built with Google Gemini, even suggests prompts that are personalized to your spending patterns.</p> <img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/starlingaitool.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.129562716614,100,73.740874566772" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Starling’s enhanced search lets you dig into all your spending habit data.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge" /> <p class="has-text-align-none">Transactions are listed by retailer and are automatically sorted into more than 50 customizable categories, like bills, transport, and groceries. This makes it easy to see how much you’ve spent at a particular retailer over a period of time, or how much you’ve spent on categories like eating out. I checked to see how much I’ve spent on McDonald’s over the past year, and let’s just say I’m off Big Macs for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">You’ll be presented with a graph and analytics about your spending habits, along with a breakdown of individual payments to retailers in a particular category. It helps address the problem of having the ability to track your payments to retailers in banking apps, but not being able to easily manipulate that data and really understand your finances.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">“We believe that anyone and everyone can be ‘Good with money,’ so we’ve designed this feature so that people can engage with their finances in a way that feels natural to them,” says Harriet Rees, CIO of Starling Bank. “The more you talk or type, the more you’ll learn about your money management.”</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Starling is one of a few <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18663036/monzo-starling-mobile-banks-uk-report">big digital banks</a> in the UK that have taken a mobile-only approach to try and shake up banking in Britain. Starling now has 4.6 million customer accounts, competing against Monzo’s <a href="https://monzo.com/annual-report">more than 12 million</a> customers and Revolut’s <a href="https://www.revolut.com/news/revolut_reaches_10_million_customers_in_the_uk/">more than 10 million</a>. All three are still far ahead of traditional banks in digital features, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499742/starling-bank-virtual-cards-feature">virtual debit cards</a>, the ability to track spending habits, and real-time transactions.</p> ]]>

The chatbot responded with a “Hmm…something seems to have gone wrong” error message to my colleague after failing to load, and users across <a href="https://x.com/0xweb3diva/status/1932364866221690971">X</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/new/">Reddit</a> are reporting platform outages.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Downdetector is showing that <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/openai/?nogeo=true&amp;_gl=1*z2a9pv*_ga*MjE0MDE3ODMzNy4xNzQ4OTM1ODAz*_ga_0PZM58H213*czE3NDk1NDY0MjUkbzMkZzEkdDE3NDk1NDcwNjYkajU3JGwwJGgw">issues started at around 3AM ET</a>, with multiple regions impacted globally. <a href="https://status.openai.com/">OpenAI’s own status page</a> said that some users started experiencing “elevated error rates and latency” at that time, noting that the issues were affecting ChatGPT, its Sora text-to-video AI tool, and OpenAI APIs. As of OpenAI added a separate line for “elevated error rates on Sora” at 5:23AM ET, and later updated the status for both to “partial outage.”</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI has since updated its status page with a consolidated message. “We have identified the root cause for the issue causing elevated errors and latency across the listed services,” the company says. “We are working on implementing a mitigation.” </p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Some users are able to access ChatGPT, but finding that the service is sluggish and taking much longer than usual to respond. Others like myself are able to use the chatbot without any issues, so the outages and errors don’t seem to be impacting every user.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Perplexity, the AI search engine service that utilizes some OpenAI models, is also experiencing outages and reporting “<a href="https://status.perplexity.com/cmbqglc8x00019b4dw876rm5a">slowness and elevated error rates</a>” on its status page. <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/perplexityai/">Perplexity’s issues started at around 7AM ET</a>, according to Downdetector, but the problem is likely connected to the OpenAI outages. </p> <p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, June 10th:</strong> Added information about Perplexity outages.</em></p> <p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, June 10th: </strong>Added that OpenAI has identified the issue and is working on a fix.</em></p> ]]>

In fact, the most attention Siri got was when Apple explained that some of its previously promised features were running behind schedule.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">To address what many saw as the elephant in the room, Apple's keynote briefly mentioned that it had updated Siri to be "more natural and more helpful," but that personalization features were still on the horizon. Those features were first mentioned at last year's WWDC, with a rollout timeline <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought">"over the course of the next year."</a></p> <p class="has-text-align-none">"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal," Craig Federighi, Apple's SVP of software engineering, said during Monday's keynote.

Popular AI apps, including Alibaba’s Qwen and ByteDance’s Doubao, have stopped picture recognition features from responding to questions about test papers, while Tencent’s Yuanbao, Moonshot’s Kimi have suspended photo-recognition services entirely during exam hours.&nbsp;</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">The increasing availability of chatbots has made it easier than ever for students around the world to cheat their way through education. Schools in the US are trying to address the issue by reintroducing paper tests, with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/chatgpt-ai-cheating-college-blue-books-5e3014a6"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporting in May</a> that sales of blue books have boomed in universities across the country over the last two years.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">The rigorous multi-day “gaokao” exams are sat by more than 13.3 million Chinese students between June 7-10th, each fighting to secure one of the limited spots at universities across the country. Students are already banned from using devices like phones and laptops during the hours-long tests, so the disabling of AI chatbots serves as an additional safety net to prevent cheating during exam season.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">When asked to explain the suspension, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports the Yuanbao and Kimi chatbots responded that functions had been disabled “to ensure the fairness of the college entrance examinations.” Similarly, the DeepSeek AI tool that went viral earlier this year is also blocking its service during specific hours “to ensure fairness in the college entrance examination,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/chinese-tech-firms-freeze-ai-tools-exam-cheats-universities-gaokao">according to <em>The Guardian</em></a>. </p> <p class="has-text-align-none">We were unable to find any public announcements from the AI companies mentioned, with <em>The Guardian</em> reporting that news around the shutdowns is being driven by students on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. The gaokao entrance exam incites fierce competition as it&#8217;s the only means to secure a college placement in China, driving concerns that students may try to improve their chances with AI tools.</p> ]]>

The Cupertino company is gearing up to unveil new versions (and new numbers) for all its operating systems, as well as taking a second step at convincing everyone it’s a major player in the AI industry.&nbsp;</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Rumor has it we may also see a whole new product category from Apple, with a HomePad smart display possibly in the offering. Here’s how to catch it all live.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">When is the WWDC keynote?</h2> <p class="has-text-align-none">While WWDC itself runs all week, the keynote with all the major announcements should take just a couple hours on Monday, June 9th. It’s set to start at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Where can I watch WWDC?</h2> <p class="has-text-align-none">The keynote event is taking place in person at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, but it’ll be streamed online too. The easiest place for most people to watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_DjDdfqtUE">will be YouTube</a>, so we’ve embedded the livestream up above. </p> <p class="has-text-align-none">If you prefer, Apple will also stream the event itself on <a href="http://apple.com">Apple.com</a> and on the Apple TV app.&nbsp;</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What to expect from Apple’s keynote</h2> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Updated OS names</h3> <p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Apple is renaming — or rather <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675945/apple-operating-systems-new-name-year-ios-macos">renumbering</a> — all of its operating systems.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Apparently this year they’ll all make the jump to iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and so on, unifying version numbers while tying them to the calendar year just after they release, which should help them sound sufficiently futuristic.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, macOS isn’t giving up its Californian names just yet. Alongside its new number, it’ll <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677892/gurman-macos-26-will-be-macos-tahoe">apparently be titled Tahoe</a>.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A new look</h3> <p class="has-text-align-none">To go with those new numbers, Apple is reportedly planning a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/627149/apple-ios-ipados-macos-design-overhaul">design overhaul for its software</a>, inspired by the look of the Vision Pro’s visionOS.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">That will mean updated icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons across iPhones, Macs, and iPads, with a look that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/apple-wwdc-2025-preview-ios-26-macos-26-new-ai-features-ipados-26-redesigns">incorporates “light and transparency.”</a> There’ll also be tweaks to toolbars, new pop-out menus that bring up extra options on a click, and larger redesigns for the Phone, Safari, and Camera apps on iPhone and iPad.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">HomePad hardware?</h3> <p class="has-text-align-none">This may be Apple’s best chance to show off its long-rumored smart display, a HomePod/iPad hybrid with a speaker and smart home controls.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">It had been rumored for a March 2025 release, but expectations then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312969/apple-smart-home-display-homepod-screen-third-quarter-2025">shifted to later this year</a>. Still, even if the release date is still a while away, Apple might want to take WWDC as an excuse to tease what it has in the works.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">AI all over again</h3> <p class="has-text-align-none">Apple can’t afford to ignore AI this year, even if Apple Intelligence <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/602270/apple-intelligence-video-container">didn’t get off to the greatest start</a>. We hope, though it might not, Apple brings a second look at its take on AI for iPhones (and beyond), even if some of the features announced a year ago still haven’t arrived.</p> <p class="has-text-align-none">Apple may have learned its lessons from last year and could focus on AI features that are a bit closer to completion, which may mean it’ll stay quiet on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669238/apple-siri-llm-ai-revamp">plans to overhaul Siri</a>. According to <em>Bloomberg</em> that’s likely to mean a focus instead on translation features, AI-powered battery optimization, and opening up Apple’s foundation AI models to third-party developers.</p> ]]>
